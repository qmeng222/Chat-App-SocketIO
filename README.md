# Chat-App-SocketIO

## Setup:

1. `npm init -y` to create a new `package.json` file with default values for all fields
2. Ensuring other developers working on the project would have the same package installed when they cloned my repository by installing Express.js and (by default) saving the package to the dependencies list in the `package.json` file: `npm i express`
3. `package-lock.json` is automatically generated by npm when installing packages. It describes the exact dependency tree of the project.
4. Install Socket.IO: `npm i socket.io`
5. Run `node index.js`
