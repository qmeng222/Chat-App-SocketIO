# Chat-App-SocketIO

## Introduction:

- Purpose: This project serves as a warmup for my larger MERN stack real-time chat application, where I'll be using React, Express, and MongoDB.
- Tech: In this project, I'll be utilizing Socket.IO to create a simple chat application that allows real-time bidirectional communication between client(s) and server. Socket.IO provides a fast and reliable real-time engine that will enable my chat app to handle many simultaneous connections with low latency.
- Features:
  - [x] Real-time individual chat and chat rooms, allowing users to have direct and private conversations.
  - [x] Headcount in each chat room, which allows users to know how many people are currently in a particular chat room, helping them decide whether or not to join.

## Setup:

1. `npm init -y` to create a new `package.json` file with default values for all fields
2. Ensuring other developers working on the project would have the same package installed when they cloned my repository by installing Express.js and (by default) saving the package to the dependencies list in the `package.json` file: `npm i express`
3. `package-lock.json` is automatically generated by npm when installing packages. It describes the exact dependency tree of the project.
4. Install Socket.IO: `npm i socket.io`
5. Run `node index.js`
